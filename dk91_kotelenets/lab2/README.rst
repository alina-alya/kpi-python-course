Python course: lab2 
=====================
*A module was created during the laboratory.*
==============================================
* **Created four classes: Creature (main class), Animal (descendant of Creature), Pet (descendant of Creature), Dog and Cat (descendants of Animal, Pet and accrdingly of Creature).**
* **In class Creature created a constructor (__init__). Also created a method for overriding the output of an object as a string (method __str__). Two more dunder-methods were also developed (__add__, __len__).** 
* **To demonstrated the logic of the created classes, a function main() was created that is called by if __name__ == '__main__':.**
* **Another file was created to demonstrate the operation of the module as a library module. The module was connected using the import command. But in the module the creation of an object for the Cat class and the output of information about it is implemented.**
